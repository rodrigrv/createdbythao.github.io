        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Texas Extra Credit (TEC) is a private student and parent loan developed specifically to help Texas residents pay for college. The company aims to assist students in paying for their college costs like housing, meal plans and books by providing competitive low interest rates to students that are enrolled at least half-time at an approved school in Texas. Although a "younger" company, TEC isn't lacking in experience, since its parent company, Higher Education Servicing Corporation (HESC), has been in the federal and private student loan servicer since 1978.

      <h3>Fresh as a Daisy</h3>
      <p>
        TEC loans are for all students, but their main target audience are new students starting their first year of college. My role as the graphic designer for this project is to bring a fresh look and style to the website while using the current brand colors and logo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Visual data is particularly important for this website (when is it not though?) since Texas Extra Credit has a lot of information that is pertinent for the person applying for an educational loan.

          Bright green and blue geometric shapes follow every main photo to break out of the typical rectangle shape.

        <p>
          Thick-lined icons encase a vibrant green background that draws users to each particular section.
