        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Destination Success is a free college and career readiness event that helps students and parents prepare for the next steps after high school. Mansfield ISD and inspirED collaborate together to provide resources and information for students through the form of presentations and on-site help during the event.

      <h3>Catching the Crowd</h3>
      <p>
        The star(s) of the show are definitely students, but that doesn't mean they're the only important group at Destination Success. Parents usually accompany the kids to see what they can do to help out with the process while learning about things like FAFSA and financial aid. Businesses, colleges and trade schools show up to show off and to answer questions from students.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means the new logo has a lot of standards to meet up to. It needs to the catch the eye of the younger crowds and seem fun. Of course, it can't seem too fun, since the logo also has to demonstrate that is an important event. All in all, the new logo needs to appeal to everyone without being a stick in the mud or completely painting the town (event center) red.

      </div>
      <h3>Stacking Blues</h3>
      <p>
        The two different tones of blues mimics the brand colors of MISD and inspirED while giving flexibility in the brand itself. With a bold typeface, the wordmark and logo itself is easy to read with a strong presence so it doesn't get lost in flyers that are usually text heavy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reality is, presentations and learning seminars doesn't really scream "enjoyable thing I wanna do" to high school students. Especially when most of the attending students are seniors who are bogged down with scholarships, financial aid and college applications. Which means the brand has to catch their attention to give them the information before they can weigh the pros and cons of attending the event.

        The event can make be overwhelming with all the topics that are available to parents and students, so breaking down information while notating important information like session are vital in every marketing piece.
