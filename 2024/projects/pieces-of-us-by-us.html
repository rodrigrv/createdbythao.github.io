        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Pieces of Us By Us showcases original artwork from talented black artists around the world in the form of jigsaw puzzles. Each puzzle celebrates black culture and history through the artist’s personal experiences, backgrounds and view of the world around them.
          <br/><br/>
          MiChelle Risby, the owner of Pieces of Us By Us, and I met through my husband. She originally needed some help with mockups and product images. After some time, she revealed she needed a re-design on the packaging of her puzzle boxes that would fully match her brand and vision. MiChelle created her brand representing the culture of black artists where things are bold, vibrant and filled with vivid colors that stands out in a sea of soft pastels.

      <h3>Puzzling It Out</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          The non-negotiating factors for the box design were:
        <ol>
          <li>The background color has to be black.</li>
          <li>The artist has to have a prominent section on the back of the box.</li>
          <li>The art has to be the main focus on the front of the box with no elements overlapping it.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Ironically enough, the limitations on the box wasn’t the main challenge. The most difficult part of the design is fitting all the information onto the box itself. Besides the art being the main focal point for the puzzle, there was a lot of text, which meant less room for everything else that also needed to share the space.

        The result came out to be a wonderful mix of showcasing the art, artist and product. To condense some of the product text, custom icons were made to break up the blocks of text, which also highlights the qualities for the consumer. Since Pieces of Us By Us attends events and pop-up shows to promote the puzzles, the top and bottom of the box showcases slivers of the art to draw in the audience.
