Which means its only acceptable to have each data point be represented in the light it deserves. Besides the numbers, the annual report highlights the mission for first timers and gives shows the goals that inspirED is reaching for.

      <h3>All About the Data</h3>
      <p>
        Face it. Numbers matter. It can show the big picture of how it all came together. The miniscule picture filled with all the nitty gritty details. And that's why the inspirED annual report is so important. The entire year's work displayed out in these wonderful bar and line graphs. With goals being met and new goals created.

        Numbers may be the hero, but the story is what draws people in. Sprinkled throughout the annual report is what inspirED provides to the public and their continuing aspirations.
